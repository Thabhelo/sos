## Introduction

The SOS Emergency App is designed to provide quick and reliable assistance in critical situations. With a one-tap activation feature, the app ensures that users can send alerts and access essential information instantly, whether during a potential kidnapping, medical emergency, or any other urgent situation. Our goal is to enhance personal safety and enable prompt responses from designated contacts.

## Features

- **Automated Triggering**: The app can be automated to trigger alerts by shaking the phone or through RFID detection.
- **My Circle**: Access a list of emergency contacts, including five favorites (e.g., 911, Mom, Dad, Sis, and Bro) at the top for immediate reach.
- **Settings Page**: Configure notifications, emergency triggers, location settings, and health monitoring features.
- **Profile Management**: Users can manage their profiles and adjust settings according to their preferences.
- **Camera and Notification Icons**: Visual icons are implemented for quick access to camera functions and notifications.

### Planned Features

- **Location Tracking**: Real-time location sharing with emergency contacts during an alert.
- **Voice Activation**: Implementing voice commands to activate emergency alerts for hands-free operation.
- **Customizable Alert Messages**: Allow users to customize the messages sent during an emergency alert.
- **Integration with Health Monitoring Devices**: Sync with devices like smartwatches for automatic health data transmission during emergencies.
- **Community Support Feature**: Connect users with nearby emergency responders or community volunteers in real-time.
- **Multiple Language Support**: Making the app accessible to a wider audience by supporting multiple languages.
- **Emergency Resources Directory**: A built-in directory of local emergency services, hospitals, and shelters.
- **User Feedback System**: Allow users to provide feedback on their experience to improve app functionality.
